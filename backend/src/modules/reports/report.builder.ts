 * split shift that genuinely adds up past the cap — the ceiling is a limit on
 * the day, so both are measured against the same total.
 *
 * `sessions` is one worker's sessions for a single work date, in login order.
 * The day is trimmed from the last shift backwards: earlier shifts are settled
 * fact by the time a later one starts, so the minutes that breach the ceiling
 * are the ones at the end of the day. Within a trimmed shift, overtime goes
 * before regular hours, so a capped day keeps every regular minute it can.
 *
 * Each logout stamp is pulled back to its own login + kept minutes, so the row
 * stays internally consistent — a reader cannot derive 12 hours from the
 * timestamps while the hours column claims 9. A shift trimmed away entirely
 * keeps its login and reads as zero minutes rather than vanishing: the worker
 * did tap in, and the sheet should still say so.
 *
 * Days at or under the cap are returned untouched, as are sessions still open
 * (no worked minutes yet) — there are no hours there to trim.
